\subsection{Study goals}

{\bfseries{Excerpt from course description:}}
The course will equip students with practical knowledge of general network theory. In particular it will address network structures and topology and explore key protocols. The course will also provide the students with knowledge of how to implement networks within business.


Sets of competences, expressing what the student will know, understand or be able to
do after completion of a process of learning, and products of this process.) Students who have successfully completed this course will have gained the following:
